## About the app
This app was designed by the students of CHRIST (Deemed to be University) in an effort to aid the teaching-learning process in government schools across Karnataka. We offer Standard X science courses based on the official textbooks prescribed. We hope that through this initiative, many students will be able to improve their performance in their tests and examinations.
